Hackathon Submission: Verizon “Flux Pulse” – AI-Driven Ephemeral Pricing Pulses
Problem Statement
Telecom pricing is stuck in static, one-size-fits-all models that fail to capture fleeting customer needs, leading to missed revenue opportunities and low VAS adoption. Traditional dynamic pricing reacts to broad trends like peak hours, but ignores “micro-moments” of user intent (e.g., a sudden need for extra data during travel or streaming spikes). This results in billions in untapped ISR, as customers don’t engage with add-ons unless perfectly timed and priced—often churning to competitors for perceived better value. The big problem: Pricing rigidity stifles organic growth, unable to transform impulse into instant revenue without feeling predatory.
Non-Traditional Solution: “Flux Pulse” – AI Ephemeral Pricing Engine
Flip pricing from rigid plans to “pulses”—ultra-short, AI-triggered pricing windows (e.g., 15-60 minutes) that offer hyper-personalized VAS discounts based on real-time micro-signals like location, app usage, or even weather/events. This isn’t traditional dynamic pricing; it’s “opportunity arbitrage,” where AI gamifies scarcity (e.g., “Pulse Alert: 50% off 5GB for your commute—expires in 20min!”) to nudge impulse buys, turning passive users into active VAS revenue sources. Small in scope (focuses only on ephemeral VAS pulses), but solves the massive issue of low engagement by making pricing feel like a timely “win” rather than a bill.
Key Features (Focused and Minimalist)
	•	Micro-Signal Detection: AI scans real-time data (location, usage spikes, external APIs like weather/traffic) to detect “pulse opportunities” without broad profiling—e.g., heavy streaming during rain? Trigger a media VAS pulse.
	•	Ephemeral Offers: Auto-generates time-bound, opt-in discounts on VAS (e.g., data boosts, content bundles, micro-insurance) priced dynamically (e.g., lower during off-peak micro-moments).
	•	Gamified Opt-In: Users get “pulse notifications” with fun elements (e.g., streak rewards for multiple pulses), encouraging habitual VAS engagement without mandatory changes.
	•	Revenue Loop: Pulses auto-convert to ISR by linking to digital wallet top-ups or mini-subscriptions, with AI learning from opt-in rates to refine future pulses.
Why Non-Traditional?
	•	Avoids blanket personalization; instead, exploits “ephemeral chaos” (unpredictable micro-events) for pricing, making it feel opportunistic and exciting—not algorithmic overreach. It’s pricing as a game, not a contract, driving viral sharing and organic growth.
Technical Architecture (MVP-Focused)
	•	Core AI Engine: Lightweight ML model (e.g., edge-deployed TensorFlow Lite) for real-time signal processing; integrates with Verizon APIs for usage/location data.
	•	Pulse Generator: Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) to create and push offers via app notifications; no heavy backend overhaul.
	•	Data Handling: Processes only transient micro-data (e.g., current session signals), ensuring privacy—complies with Verizon NSA standards.
	•	Prototype Build: GitLab repo with Python script for pulse simulation, Streamlit dashboard for demo, and mock API integrations for quick testing.
Benefit Illustration


Example Use Case
During a traffic jam, Mia’s app detects high navigation usage and a weather alert. Flux Pulse triggers: “Pulse Alert: 2GB extra data + traffic premium VAS for $1—valid 30min!” Mia opts in, streams podcasts seamlessly, and auto-subscribes to a mini-VAS bundle—turning frustration into revenue and loyalty.
Compliance & Implementation
	•	Prototyping: MVP as an app plugin with simulated pulses; full GitLab submission and shareable demo.
	•	Standards: Aligns with Verizon NSA (ephemeral data only, user consent for opt-ins); no persistent tracking.
	•	Team Fit: Draws on AI/ML expertise for signal detection and A/B testing.
Why This Wins the Hackathon
This tiny pulse mechanism punches through pricing inertia, solving the giant revenue gap with non-traditional, gamified ephemerality—driving bold, organic VAS growth and high-value customers in a fresh, customer-empowering way. It’s simple, scalable, and disruptively fun, perfectly fitting the Disruptathon’s innovation spirit.
